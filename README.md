> This is a fork of a [huxiaoxu2019/hass-addon-frp-client](https://github.com/huxiaoxu2019/hass-addon-frp-client) kindly provided by Xiaoxu Hu.

It takes only one parameter, which is a path to `frpc` config. This allows you to provide arbitrary configuration while having `frpc` be run in a managed way by Home Assistant OS Supervisor.

> [!CAUTION]
> Misconfigured frpc can expose your Home Assistant instance to the internet without protection
